A simple android weather application in kotlin to demonstrate the usage for MVVM design pattern using LiveData, RxJava, View-DataBinding, Retrofit, Moshi, Koin (Dependency Injection), based on Clean Architecture & Gradle Dependency Management (GDM) . The application supports caching using retrofits default caching mechanism.

### Libarary/Tools Used
-   [MVVM Architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/arch/) - Robust, testable, and maintainable app with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data persistence.
- [Clean Architecture]() - Isolates UI, business logic and data sources' responsibilities creating a Testable system
-  [KOIN](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) - A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin
-    [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android [Support Library]
-  [Lifecycles](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
-  [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
-  [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
-  [Test](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/) - An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests.
